        <h2>WOMEN'S RIGHTS IN THE UK</h2>
        <p>The UK, like most countries, was historically a patriarchal society, where a woman's rights and freedoms were mainly determined by the social standing of her husband and/or father. Women could not vote, work, own property, or enjoy many of the freedoms we take for granted today, such as free assembly or speech. Thanks to the efforts of innumerable incredible women the world we live in now has changed and improved in many ways, but the fight for gender equality is one that is still very much ongoing. We aim to empower women to find a voice and contribute to making the world a better and fairer place.</p>

        <h2>TIMELINE</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1870 - <b>The Married Women's Property Act is passed.</b> This allowed women to own property in their own right, where previously a woman had to give this up to her husband upon marriage. This includes both physical (i.e. a house) and intellectual (i.e. the copyright to a book she had written) property. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbara_Bodichon" target="_blank">Barbara Bodichon</a>, a founder of the first women's higher education facility, was crucial in lobbying for the act.</li>
            <li>1891 - <b>The right of men to use corporal punishment on their wives is revoked.</b> It was only in 1857 that divorce was first considered a civil procedure as opposed to a religious one, and 1878 that physical abuse by a spouse considered proper grounds.<br><b>Domestic violence is never acceptable.</b> If you or someone you know has been affected by it, there are <a href="https://www.womensaid.org.uk/information-support/" target ="_blank">resources</a> available to you to get out of the situation.</li>
            <li>1913 - <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emily_Davison" target="_blank">Emily Davidson</a> throws herself in front of the King's horse</b> at the 1913 Derby. The Suffragette movement had been campaigning for women's rights to vote for 10 years since their foundation by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmeline_Pankhurst" target="_blank">Emmeline Pankhurst</a>, and this incident made them too big to ignore, making headlines all over the world. Davidson herself was a devoted Suffragette, who went on hunger strike seven times in the name of her cause. 50,000 people lined the route of her funeral procession.</li>
            <li>1918 - <b>The first women were allowed to vote in UK parliamentary elections.</b> The Representation of the People Act enfranchised land-owning women over the age of 30 for the first time. The following year, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nancy_Astor,_Viscountess_Astor" target="_blank">Nancy Astor</a> became the first female MP in the UK, representing the Conservative Party.</li>
            <li>1928 - <b>All women are granted the vote on equal conditions to men.</b> This allowed any woman over the age of 21 to vote. This act enfranchised over 5 million women and for the first time in 1929, more women voted than men. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millicent_Fawcett" target="_blank">Millicent Fawcett</a>, who had campaigned for equality and rights since the 1860s, was crucial in getting it passed.</li>
            <li>1961 - <b>The contraceptive pill is first made available on the NHS,</b> giving women control over their own sexual health for the first time. This would be followed by the <b>Abortion Act of 1967</b>, which legalised the practice in Great Britain. These two acts were important in freeing women to make their own sexual choices and in making sex seen not as a duty to one's husband, but as a pleasure they could engage in as freely as men, though societal attitudes did not - and still have not - fully catch up.</li>
            <li>1970 - <b>The Equal Pay Act is passed</b>, prohibiting employers from paying their female staff less than men doing the same job. Based the 1963 American law of the same name, it was a central part of the Labour Party Manifesto from 1964. It would be followed in <b>1975 by the Sexual Discrimination Act</b> which made gender based discrimination in the workplace, education and training illegal. An addendum was added to this in <b>1999 which gave the same rights to Trans people.</b></li>
            <li>1994-2004 - <b>Rape within marriage and Domestic violence are recognised as crimes.</b> It's f*cking disgusting it took that long and researching it has made me feel a bit sick...</li>
