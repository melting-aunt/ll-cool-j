        <h2>WHAT WE DO</h2>
        <p>We are a safe space to talk, share and meet other like-minded young women and girls. We talk about the issues important to <b>YOU</b>, such as mental health and wellbeing, hate crimes, LGBTQ+ discussions and much much more. (If you want to raise a topic for one of our meetings, feel free to post on the <a href="discussion.html">Discussion Board!</a>) We do videography, photography and other activities that aim to build confidence and teamwork. We meet every Tuesday at 4.30 at Heaton Norris Community Centre, with free food cooked each week by one of our regular members.</p>
